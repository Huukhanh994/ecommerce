# IDE
Iâ€™m using visual studio code because its simple and easy to use These are mac commands
My favourite commands are
* Cmd + p (quick search a file by name in the folder)
* Control + ~ (it will open terminal in the current folder)
* Cmd + r (replace)
* Cmd + f (find)
* The above are common commands but very useful
* Shift + cmd + p (command palette which is used to beautifier (tobeautify html and css))
* Cmd + / (comment the line)
* Cmd + d (replace all the same values at a time)
* Ctrl + r (for recent files)
* Shift + cmd + up arrow(selects entire text above)
* Shift + cmd + down arrow(selects entire text above)
